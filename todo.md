# Backlog

Tracked features that aren't yet scheduled. Promote to a spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/` when ready to design properly.

## Big-ticket items

### Salesforce Contact discovery (DEFERRED — investigated 2026-06-01, blocked)
Attempted: discover Contacts the user hasn't yet visited in SF, by calling Lightning UI API endpoints that search or list Contacts.

**Outcome:** all three discovery endpoints we tried are unavailable on the Overwolf SF org / Standard user license:
- `/services/data/v60.0/ui-api/search-suggestions?q=...&types=Contact` → 404 NOT_FOUND
- `/services/data/v60.0/search?q=FIND+{...}+IN+ALL+FIELDS+RETURNING+Contact(...)` → 401 INVALID_SESSION_ID (SOSL requires API-Enabled permission this license doesn't have)
- `/services/data/v60.0/ui-api/list-records/Contact/__Recent` → 404
- `/services/data/v60.0/ui-api/list-info/Contact` → 404

By contrast, these endpoints DO work and power the current data layer:
- `/services/data/v60.0/ui-api/records/<id>?fields=...`
- `/services/data/v60.0/ui-api/related-list-records/<id>/<relName>?fields=...`

**Conclusion:** discovery is blocked without a permission change at the SF org level (likely requires the "API Enabled" profile permission, which Overwolf does not grant Standard users). Workable workarounds (DOM-scraping the Contact list view page, maintaining a hardcoded list of IDs) aren't worth the brittleness.

**Current behavior is acceptable:** visit a Contact in SF once → tool caches Name + Discord field + related Opps → strategy 3 matches by user-ID → Discord field → Contact name first-word. Covers the common case.

### LinkedIn flow
Same end-to-end UX as Discord, but for LinkedIn messages.

- New module: `src/linkedin/` mirroring `src/discord/` (selection, ui, content-script).
- One line in `vite.config.ts` to add `https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/*` to the match list.
- Counterparty key should be the **LinkedIn profile URL** (the `linkedin.com/in/<slug>` part), not the display name — much more stable.
- Need to confirm: what's the SF custom field's API name on Contact for LinkedIn URL? (Probably `LinkedIn_URL__c` or `LinkedIn__c`. Check Contact page in SF.)
- New SF-side reader (analogous to `readContactDiscordUsername`) to capture LinkedIn URL from the Contact page.
- Open question: How does LinkedIn's messaging DOM expose the counterparty's profile URL? Need a brief reconnaissance session before writing the spec.
- Risk: LinkedIn changes their DOM more often than Discord — expect 1-2 selector fixes per year.

## Small QoL items

### Stage-based picker filtering
Currently we capture `stage` on cached Opps but show all of them. If the picker gets noisy for long-tenured Contacts (10+ historical Opps), default to showing **open Opps only** with a "show closed too" toggle. Revisit only if it actually becomes a problem.

### Account-scoped picker
A 4.5th strategy: when the Account is known but no specific Contact, show that Account's Opps. Niche — typically Account is only known *because* we found a Contact, in which case strategy 3 already handles it.

### Disambiguation prompt for duplicate Discord handles
Current behaviour for two Contacts sharing a Discord handle: pick the most-recently-focused. If this turns out to bite, add a "we found 2 Contacts with this handle — which one?" prompt before the picker.

## Architecture / hygiene

### Cross-user cache sharing
Each Tampermonkey install has its own cache today, by design (no backend). If the tool gets used by a wider team, a shared sync layer (Cloudflare Workers KV, Supabase, etc.) becomes worth considering. Out of scope until there's a clear need.

### Auto-write Discord field back to Salesforce
After a popup pick that includes implicit handle learning (fold-in A from the contact-opps spec), also queue a tab-open to the Contact's edit page with `defaultFieldValues=Discord__c=<handle>` so the value lands in SF too. Useful but adds tab clutter and a manual Save step. Hold off unless local-only learning proves insufficient.
